# EncipherChat 

## OVERVIEW
A chat application built with cryptographic algorithms, enabling users to communicate safely through a centralized server.  
Messages are **encrypted end-to-end** before transmission, ensuring privacy and protection against eavesdropping.. Key areas covered in this project include:  
- **Socket Programming**  
- **Real-Time Communication**  
- **End-to-End Encryption**  

## FEATURES 
- **Supports multiple users** for seamless communication.  
- **Offers multiple encryption methods**, allowing users to choose between:  
  - **DES** (Single Key Encryption)  
  - **RSA & ElGamal** (Two-Key Encryption)  
- **Includes a Third Trusted Party (TTP)** to facilitate secure communication between users.  

## TECH STACK 
- **Python** – Backend development  
- **Tkinter** – User interface design  
- **Socket Module** – Real-time message transmission
